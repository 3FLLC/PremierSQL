# Premier SQL Client

* This arcive contains a 64bit Windows binary for PSQL Client v1.1 (EXE no installer)

This client was built for MacOS, Windows and Linux in less than 7 work days. I was not informed that the University was going to use
the PSQL Server until Friday last week ~ today is Wednesday (build was complete at 12:05am this morning).

## As this is Version 1.1

__Please Consider This Release Candidate 1__

As I receive more specifications from the professor teaching, I will add more menu options to 'simplify' talking to an SQL server
for those who do not have the technical experience dealing with SQL syntax. (For example, Menu -> Tables -> Browse prompts for the
TABLE NAME and then executes SELECT * FROM *TABLE NAME*). There will be additional menu options added to execute actual SQL commands
with the intention of focusing on functional goal, not how...

In the meantime, using Menu -> Tables -> Query -> get Resultset - puts the client into simple SQL w/ Result mode... e.g. SELECT mode.

Whereas, Menu -> Tables -> Query -> Execute SQL - put the client into simple SQL w/o Result mode... e.g. INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, etc.
